# Starting the road
So this website is a way to track all of the things that i get up to in a hope that i can use this as part of my CV. At the moment the page is just very simply a HUGO page with a blog attached to it. We will just have to see where it goes.

# My Goals - WorkWise
So i suppose i should start with what i currently do now. I work for a Co-operative in the UK as a Cloud & Datacenter Specialist. My day to day consists of managing virtual servers (VMWare) and the hardware that it sits on. We also get involved with most projects that involve anything infrastructrey (*if thats even a word*). I work with mainly windows systems but have dabbled in linux and i am starting to do more and more linux in and out of work (more on this later).
### Where do i see myself in 5 years?
Firstly i hate it when people ask me this question, but i do know where i want to be just dont know how long it will take me to get there. I would like to become an SRE (*Site Reliability Engineer*). I know for somepeople that this will just be a buzz word, or even have no idea what this is.
