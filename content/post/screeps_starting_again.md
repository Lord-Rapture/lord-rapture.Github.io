## Screeps day 1
So just been messing around on screeps for the last day or so on and off and I have got it to a good point now I think.

As you can see from the picture I have got some basics set up. Starters (early harvesters/upgraders), Repairers & Builders. As stated before you can see all the code in my Gitlab. I have also just got myself set up on shard0 but I think this will be a long thing as the tick rate is so slow. 

So this was only a quick one but just thought I would post on my progress
