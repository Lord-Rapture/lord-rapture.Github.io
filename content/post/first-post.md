# Starting the road
So this website is a way to track all of the things that i get up to in a hope that i can use this as part of my CV. At the moment the page is just very simply a HUGO page with a blog attached to it. We will just have to see where it goes.

# My Goals - WorkWise
So i suppose i should start with what i currently do now. I work for a Co-operative in the UK as a Cloud & Datacenter Specialist. My day to day consists of managing virtual servers (VMWare) and the hardware that it sits on. We also get involved with most projects that involve anything infrastructrey (*if thats even a word*). I work with mainly windows systems but have dabbled in linux and i am starting to do more and more linux in and out of work (more on this later). Recently at work we have started a move to azure, this is going to be a long process but i am at the forfrount of this. :)
### Where do i see myself in 5 years?
Firstly i hate it when people ask me this question, but i do know where i want to be just dont know how long it will take me to get there. I would like to become an SRE (*Site Reliability Engineer*). I know for somepeople that this will just be a buzz word, or even have no idea what this is here is a quick link to describe what they do [Google SRE Page](https://sre.google/). This is what i want to be doing, hopefully this page will help me get there.

# My Goals - HomeWise
I do a few things at home including reading tech books & blogs, Some of which i will be rewiewing and sharing my thoughts on this blog. I also do some coding and i am starting to get into bug bounty hunting. Havn't had my first bug that was worth anything yet but i will also share that on here. I also tinker around with loads of tech things at home.

Well thats it for today hopefully i will add something to this site every week at the least just an update on whats going on.

Elliott
