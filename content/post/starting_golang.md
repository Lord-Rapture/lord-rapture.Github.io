## Coding ... a dark art
So I have messed around with coding quite a bit in a couple of different languages python, javascript, C# and golang. But going forwards I need to pick one and get good at it. Now that was a difficult decision to make. If I was to say which one I knew the most about at the moment I would pick Python. But after reading many articles and watching many videos on youtube, it appears that golang is more up and comping for SRE's. So will learn golang first I may come back to other languages.

### The Blog
So this website is run with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo is an open-source static website generator written in go. Hopefully in the future, I will be able to add to this project.

### What & how
I have brought a udemy course [Go Bootcamp: Master Golang with 1000+](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-go-the-complete-bootcamp-course-golang/) for Golang and I am slowly walking through it. I am going to attempt to do an hour a day. 30 mins before I start work and 30 mins when I have finished work. I will be posting everything on my 

### Screeps
My javascript has been learnt through the game [Screeps](https://screeps.com/). I have it through Steam. As I am currently building out the code there is not much to go on but you can check the code out on my [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/l.rapture/screeps-typescript) page. All of the main code is in the src folder. The rest of it is for turning typescript into javascript that screeps can recognise. I have set up a private server in docker on one of my docker hosts and this is what I'm starting with. I will progress onto the Shards (full multiplayer world) This has been taken from the developers own GitHub repo. I will be writing posts purely on screeps so keep an eye out for the screeps tags.
If there are any fellow screepers out there and you would like to play screeps along with me I will set up a screeps server in Azure for other people to play along with me. If this is the case Drop me an email.
